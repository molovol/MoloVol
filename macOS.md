Previous versions can be downloaded in the [Releases Section](https://github.com/molovol/MoloVol/releases) 
of our GitHub page.

### Installation
The installation file comes in the form of a dmg file. Mac users will likely be familiar with 
this type of installer. Open the file and drag MoloVol into your applications folder.

When opening MoloVol for the first time, a warning may appear saying that the application is 
from an unknown developer (see image). This is because Apple requires a fee to registered as trusted developer. 
To get around the warning, you can navigate to your "Applications" folder and find the MoloVol 
executable. Right-click or control-click the executable and select "Open". You will be prompted 
with a dialog box where you will need to select "Open" and add MoloVol as an exception. 
[Apple's support website](https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac) provides a 
more detailed guide.
