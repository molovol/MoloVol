[Download installer.](https://github.com/molovol/MoloVol/releases/download/v1.1.0/MoloVol_macOS-10.11+_v1.1.0.dmg)

### Installation
You can download the application binary as .dmg file. Opening that file will mount it and open a window containing the application and your system's application folder. To install the application, simply drag it into the application folder.

When opening MoloVol for the first time, a warning may appear saying that the application is from an unknown developer. This is because Apple requires a fee to registered as trusted developer. To get around the warning, you can navigate to your "Applications" folder and find the MoloVol executable. Right-click or control-click the executable and select "Open". You will be prompted with a dialog box where you will need to select "Open" and add MoloVol as an exception. [Apple's support website](https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac) provides a more detailed guide.
