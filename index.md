MoloVol is a free, cross-plattform, scientific software for volume and surface computations of single molecules and crystallographic unit cells.

## Utility
With the MoloVol software we aim to combine an intuitive and easy-to-use user interface with powerful computing algorithms. We want the software to serve a broad range of scientist by being easily accessible on all common platforms.

The MoloVol software, along with many of its features, is currently in pre-release. The software is being actively developed on Windows 10, macOS Big Sur, and Ubuntu.
