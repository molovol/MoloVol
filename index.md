MoloVol is a free, cross-plattform, scientific software for volume and surface 
computations of single molecules and crystallographic unit cells. We aim to 
combine an intuitive and easy-to-use user interface with powerful computing 
algorithms. We want the software to serve a broad range of scientist by being 
easily accessible on all common platforms.

The software is being maintained and developed by Jasmin B. Maglic and Roy Lavendomme
and is available on Windows 10, macOS, and Ubuntu. The application is also available
as a [**Web App**](https://app.molovol.com).

### Scientific Reference
MoloVol v1.0.0 features and algorithms are presented in detail in an 
[openly accessible scientific article](https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576722004988) 
published in the *Journal of Applied Crystallography*.

### Calculation Showcase
MoloVol can calculate various types of surface areas and volumes of molecular systems and their cavities. MoloVol can notably generate surface maps to visualize the calculation results in graphic softwares like [PyMOL](https://pymol.org/2/) or [ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/). Images below were rendered with [PyMOL Open-Source](https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source).
