MoloVol is a free, cross-plattform, scientific software for volume and surface 
computations of single molecules and crystallographic unit cells. We aim to 
combine an intuitive and easy-to-use user interface with powerful computing 
algorithms. We want the software to serve a broad range of scientist by being 
easily accessible on all common platforms.

The software is being maintained and developed by Jasmin B. Maglic and Roy Lavendomme
and is available on Windows (7, 8, 10, 11), macOS, Linux (Ubuntu, Debian), and as a web application.

### News

We have released version 1.1.1 which introduces a small patch to increase the calculation
speed by around 50%. Other than that, this version is equivalent to the previous version,
so we encourage everyone to upgrade.

If you have previously experienced instability of the web app, its newest version fixes an
issue that led to crashes. With this new change the web app should be more reliable.

### Calculation Showcase
MoloVol can calculate various types of surface areas and volumes of molecular systems and their
cavities. Notably, MoloVol can generate surface maps to visualize the calculation results in graphics
softwares such as [PyMOL](https://pymol.org/2/) or [ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/).
