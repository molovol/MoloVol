#### Scientific tools should be transparent
When you use MoloVol, you should not need to
trust us as developers. That's why MoloVol is open source, meaning its source code is
fully accessible. You can download the code, run it yourself and verify that
it does what we claim.

You can find the source code on our
[Github page](https://github.com/molovol/MoloVol).
The GitHub repository houses the current development build. You can access stable versions in
the
[_Releases_](https://github.com/molovol/MoloVol/releases) section.
Each stable version is also tagged.

If you are looking for a description of the algorithms used in MoloVol, read the
[companion article](https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576722004988).
