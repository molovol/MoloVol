### April 2025

We are proud to release a new update to MoloVol. Version 1.2 now comes with an in-built 
renderer, meaning that users can finally see and inspect the results of their calculations
without the need of any third-party programs.

I think this will be a huge quality-of-life improvement for all our users. Spread the word!

### October 2024

The website is getting a major facelift. We've gotten to a point where it's just not feasible
anymore to dump all information on one big homepage. Getting into web development is a big 
undertaking for me because I have no formal training. But it's been a lot of fun.
In any case, I hope that the new website is more
user-friendly and more aesthetically pleasing.

We're also preparing a big update to the app. We've sent out a beta version to some testers
and hope to roll out the update as soon as possible.

### July 2023

We have released version 1.1.1 which introduces a small patch to increase the calculation
speed by around 50%. Other than that, this version is equivalent to the previous version,
so we encourage everyone to upgrade.

If you have previously experienced instability of the web app, its newest version fixes an
issue that led to crashes. With this new change the web app should be more reliable.
