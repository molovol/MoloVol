#### Changes since v1.0.0

{% include latestchanges.html %}

Previous versions can be downloaded in the [Releases Section](https://github.com/molovol/MoloVol/releases) 
of our GitHub page.

### Installation

The app is usable directly after download. The executable file along with all necessary resources are packed
together in a zip file. Simply extract the files in the desired installation location and make sure that 
MoloVol.exe and the "inputfile" folder stay in the same location. To run, simply execute MoloVol.exe.

Depending on the Windows version and the security settings, a security warning may appear because MoloVol 
does not have a registered certificat (they are costly). You may proceed safely (unless you obtained the 
program from another source than here).
