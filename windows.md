### Installation
On windows, the application does not require an actual setup. The executable file and input files are all provided in a zip folder. Extract all files in any desired directory (note that "MoloVol.exe" and the "inputfile" folder should remain in the same directory) then start the program by running MoloVol.exe.

Depending on the version of windows and the security settings, a security warning might appear because MoloVol does not have a registered certificat (they are costly). You may proceed safely (unless you obtained the program from another source than here).
