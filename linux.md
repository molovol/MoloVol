### Installation
You can download an installation file as .deb file. This file format is used on Debian and Ubuntu. Installation for these systems should be as simple as opening the file; however, if you run into issues you can also run the installation from the command line.
```
$ dpkg -i bin/MoloVol_debian_version.deb 
```

Please note that for older versions we only provide the .deb file for arm64 CPU architectures. As such, it is possible that the installer will not work for you. In that case you could compile the application yourself by following [this guide](https://github.com/molovol/MoloVol/wiki/Getting-started-on-Linux).
